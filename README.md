# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). 

Users can create an account to store all of their TinyURLS. The links are accessible to all, but can only be edited or deleted by the user who created them.

This project was built in Week 3 of Lighthouse Labs' Web Development Bootcamp.
